# Self Introduction

Hi, my name is Shreya. I have around 2 years of experience as a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer. Currently, I’m working at BR SQR IT Solutions Pvt. Ltd., where I’ve been contributing for the past 2 years. I am experienced in building end-to-end machine learning projects, from problem definition and data preprocessing to model building, validation, and deployment.
My expertise includes libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow, and I work with tools such as Jupyter Notebook and VS Code. I have hands-on experience with supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest, Linear Regression, KNN, and Logistic Regression.
I am proficient in Python and SQL, with strong skills in data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Additionally, I have a strong proficiency in databases such as Oracle SQL and SQL Server, which I leverage for data extraction and manipulation.
Currently, I am working on a Generative AI-based content creation project, where I am fine-tuning a GPT model to automate personalized product descriptions for retail websites. This project aims to streamline catalog creation and improve content generation efficiency by 50%, reducing the time and effort spent on manually writing descriptions for a wide range of products.
I also have experience as both an individual contributor and a team member, and I am confident in handling projects independently. This is all about me.
